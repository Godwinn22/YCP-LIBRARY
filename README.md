## ycp-library

This is a Website for the YCP's Library.

The most important thing to create a design is good tools & its emphasis. This website provides its users
an effective and efficient way of using a library through a library card.

The Landing page offers you a variety of literature genres. It looks like a bookshelf where the recent
bestsellers and DVDS are placed.
The first section of the page is where with your library card ðŸŽ´, you can stream and download musics, movies, Ebooks,
read magazines/news, e.t.c.

Cool dark blue color creates a peaceful and comfortable atmosphere. Itâ€™s unique and better for ðŸ“– reading
than the others as it doesnâ€™t make your eyes ðŸ‘€ tired. Basically, itâ€™s used to represent elegance and
intelligence. Cyan sets accents in this site. It is typically associated with liveliness, youth and energy ðŸ’ª. It
invites you to plunge into the sea of books.

The third section of the page emphasizes on rendering supports and shelter to the homeless and less priviledges.
The fourth page helps users to book and reserve room/space studying and meetings. You can as well
borrow and reserve a computer with 160 minutes free internet access per day.
